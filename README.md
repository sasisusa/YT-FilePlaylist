# YT-FilePlaylist

Poor something to play a own created playlist from a file.

## Needed
* Web browser
* node.js

	if there is an error or problem with the opn-module, or should they not be found: 
	`$ npm install opn` or global shared `$ npm install -g opn`
  
## Run
`$ node yt-fpl.js`

## Application description
Not needed.

### Bad style
Don't care about the mashup with " " and ' ' for now.
